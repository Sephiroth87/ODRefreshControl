!http://www.orangeinaday.com/img/ODRefreshControl.jpg!

ODRefreshControl is a "pull down to refresh" control for UIScrollView, like the one Apple introduced in iOS6, but available to anyone from iOS4 and up.

h2. Installation

* Drag the @ODRefreshControl/ODRefreshControl@ folder into your project. 
* Add the *QuartzCore* framework to your project.
* @#import "ODRefreshControl.h"@

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Demo@)

h3. Adding a refresh control to your table view

<pre>
ODRefreshControl *refreshControl = [[ODRefreshControl alloc] initInScrollView:self.scrollView];
</pre>

To know when the refresh operation has started, add an action method to the UIControlEventValueChanged event of the control

<pre>
[refreshControl addTarget:self action:@selector(dropViewDidBeginRefreshing:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];
</pre>

If youâ€™d like to programmatically start the refresh operation, use

<pre>
[refreshControl beginRefreshing];
</pre>

Remember to tell the control when the refresh operation has ended

<pre>
[refreshControl endRefreshing];
</pre>

h4. Customization

The @ODRefreshControl@ can be customized using the following properties:

<pre>
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *tintColor;
@property (nonatomic, assign) UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle activityIndicatorViewStyle;
</pre>
